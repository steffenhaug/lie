# Lie
#### Pronounced (/liː/ LEE)

Lie is a lisp-like programming language implemented in haskell, loosely based on the 
["Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)
implementation of a limited Scheme. It is similar in the sense that you have to write many parantheses,
but not in many other ways.
